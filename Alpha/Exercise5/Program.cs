//New NameProcessor class.
//Holds names of people (first names are all we need)
//The class fixes capitalization of first name (i.e. it turns "bob" into "Bob")
//Class has two methods:  Add and GetNamesStartingWith
//Calling code can fill the process up with as many names as it wishes.
//The GetNamesStartingWith will return all names it knows about that start with a given string parameter.
//Be sure to show an example of the code working (i.e. being called from Main).
